    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package dry ziti pasta</li>
        <li>1 pound mild Italian sausage</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) container ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 large yellow onion, minced</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 ½ (26 ounce) jars spaghetti sauce, divided</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package shredded Italian cheese blend</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is
            boiling, stir in the ziti, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the
            pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in
            the sink.</li>
        <li>While pasta is cooking, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add the sausage, and cook and stir until
            brown, about 10 minutes. Drain sausage and set aside.</li>
        <li>Stir together the ricotta, egg, onion, garlic, and oregano in a large bowl until well combined. Stir in the
            drained pasta, the drained sausage, salt, pepper, and 1/2 jar of the spaghetti sauce; mix well.</li>
        <li>In the prepared baking dish, cover the bottom with 1/3 jar of spaghetti sauce. Layer 1/2 of the pasta
            mixture, 1/3 jar of spaghetti sauce, and 1/2 of the shredded cheese. Then layer the remaining 1/2 of the
            pasta, 1/3 of the sauce, and 1/2 of the cheese. Sprinkle with basil. Cover the dish tightly with aluminum
            foil.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until heated through, about 20 minutes. Uncover; return to the oven and bake
            until cheese is melted, 5 to 10 more minutes.</li>
    </ol>
