        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 white onion, diced</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper, diced</li>
        <li>1 green bell pepper, diced</li>
        <li>1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup</li>
        <li>1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of chicken soup</li>
        <li>1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chile peppers (such as RO*TEL®)</li>
        <li>1 cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ancho chile powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon chipotle chile powder</li>
        <li>1 cooked chicken, torn into shreds or cut into chunks</li>
        <li>8 ounces shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>10 corn tortillas, cut into quarters</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat. Saute onion, red bell pepper, and green bell pepper in hot oil
            until warmed through, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Combine onion-pepper mixture, cream of mushroom soup, cream of chicken soup, diced tomatoes, chicken broth,
            sour cream, cumin, ancho chile powder, oregano, and chipotle chile powder together in a large bowl and stir
            until sauce is well-combined.</li>
        <li>Spread a few tablespoons of the sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Spread 1/2 the chicken over
            the sauce. Spread about half the sauce over the chicken and top with 1/3 the cheese. Spread a layer of
            tortillas over the cheese. Spread remaining 1/2 the chicken over the tortillas, and top with almost all of
            the remaining sauce, reserving 1/2 cup sauce. Top with 1/3 the cheese, remaining tortillas, the reserved 1/2
            cup sauce, and remaining 1/3 cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake casserole in the preheated oven until bubbling, about 40 minutes. Increase the oven temperature to
            broil. Broil the casserole until top is golden, 2 to 3 minutes more.</li>
    </ol>
